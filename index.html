        <p><h1>Welcome ✨</h1></p>
        <p>
        Hi, I'm Allie 🧜🏻‍♀️ I've created this site to tell you a little more about me and my projects. All opinions, statements, writing, etc are purely my own and are not endorsed by my employer, my friends, my family, or anyone else!
        </p>
        <p><h2>Who am I?</h2></p>
        <p>
        Mostly a nerd 👩🏼‍💻 I'm currently working at GitHub helping people to make the most of GitHub. Prior to GitHub I've been in a lot of different jobs - everything from working AV 🎤 and concerts 🎶 to face painting 👩🏼‍🎨. Most recently prior to GitHub, I was at UCL as an IT and AV service manager. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I love cats 😻, glittery things 💖, and more. My favourite colour is pink and I really appreciate kawaii fashion. Hugs are good, and the world needs more love for one another 🫶! Be kind ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
        </p>
        <p><h3>Hobby Projects</h3></p>
        <p>
        I regularly work on hobby projects, and I'm always looking for new things to learn and try. I have an interest in tech, especially cute technology! Hardware and networking are my current interests, and I also have an interest in information security. Some projects of interest include:
        </p>
        <p><h3>Allienet (AS205789)</h3></p>
        <p>
        Allienet is a small home network that I run for fun. I'm currently announcing a single IPv6 subnet from my home, where it's being used by me, friends, family, visitors, and for general learning. I'm looking to expand Allienet in the future as I learn more about how the Internet works and develop my skills. For network operations issues, please contact me at netz@cutegirls.club
        </p>
        <p><h3>cute girls club</h3></p>
        <p>
        <a href="https://cutegirls.club">cute girls club</a> is a virtual treehouse for my friends and I to hang out. It's a place for us to be ourselves, it is very queer and leftist. The website and design are intended to be a flashback to 90s/00s internet, and in the theme of things I created in my childhood. We primarily hang out on Discord, and if you're one of my friends who wants an invite, please let me know &#60;3 
        </p>
        <p><h3>Candy the Catacorn</h3></p>
        <p>
        <a href="https://galaxyallie.space/Candy-the-Catacorn/">Candy the Catacorn</a> 🐱🦄 is a catacorn-themed mini badge. It has capacitive touch ears and lots of LEDs, and is a lot of fun to build and a great beginner project that kids and grown-ups alike can build and have fun with.
        </p>
        <p>
        This board was prototyped with the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500">Adafruit Trinket M0</a> so if you don't like my adaptations or just want to learn things yourself, that's probably a good place to start. Same for Meow Meow Ears below, but less so (e.g. they have no DotStar-compatible LED for status).
