# Welcome

Hi, I'm Allie :) I've created this site to tell you a little more about me and my projects. All opinions, statements, writing, etc are purely my own and are not endorsed by my employer, my friends, my family, or anyone else!

## Who am I?

Mostly a nerd :) I'm currently working at, and loving, GitHub. Prior to GitHub I've been in a lot of different jobs - everything from working AV and concerts to face painting at festivals. Most recently, I was at UCL as a service manager. 

I love cats, glittery things, and more :D my favourite colour is pink and I really appreciate kawaii fashion. Hugs are good, and the world needs more love for one another! Be kind :) 

## Hobby Projects

While I have a lot of things I tinker with, I currently have two reasonably complete, ready-to-build projects on GitHub. Both fit nicely in kawaii-themed things and are fun projects for all ages:

### Candy the Catacorn

[Candy the Catacorn](https://galaxyallie.space/Candy-the-Catacorn/) is a catacorn-themed mini badge. It has capacitive touch ears and lots of LEDs, and is a lot of fun to build and a great beginner project that kids and grown-ups alike can build and have fun with.

This board was prototyped with the [Adafruit Trinket M0](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500) so if you don't like my adaptations or just want to learn things yourself, that's probably a good place to start. Same for Meow Meow Ears below, but less so (e.g. they have no DotStar-compatible LED for status).

### Meow Meow Ears

[Meow Meow Ears](https://github.com/GalaxyAllie/MeowMeowEars) are a pair of RGB cat ears on a headband. The boards are designed to fit into most typical cat ear headbands and the sample code is designed for [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
